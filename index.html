        <p>Of Washtenaw County’s cities, Ann Arbor is by far the largest and wealthiest. The University of Michigan bolsters the economy of the region by attracting young workers, wealthy tourists, and skilled educators and doctors. At first glance most of the cities around Ann Arbor seem to benefit from the attractive power the university has. Dexter and Saline maintain high rates of education, as over half of their adult populations hold a bachelor's degree, and the average income of these cities remains about the same as that of their wealthy neighbor, Ann Arbor. 
  
However, when one turns to Ypsilanti, the city closest to Ann Arbor both by distance and historical ties, we see that Ypsilanti is a far different story from the others. Ypsilanti holds a much higher rate of poverty than Ann Arbor, and on average, a household in Ypsilanti makes $20,000 less than a household in Ann Arbor. University of Michigan Professor Alford A. Young Jr suggests that this is a result of systemic oppression. He says that something else one might notice when they look at census data on Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti is a clear racial disparity. 
  
According to census data, Ypsilanti’s population is over one quarter black, whereas Ann Arbor’s population is just 7% black, and the surrounding cities' populations are all less than 2% black. Washtenaw county’s research supports the hypothesis that there is a great racial disparity across the county. According to <a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2018/09/heres_what_high_and_low_opport.html"> Lauren Slagter</a>, out of 83 counties in the state of Michigan, Washtenaw county ranked 80th for income inequality in 2015.

      <p>Washtenaw County now tracks the inequities within the county using its <a href="http://www.opportunitywashtenaw.org/">Opportunity Index</a> to report its findings to the public. The Opportunity Index found that black residents in Washtenaw County have a life expectancy 13 years shorter than that of white residents. The Index also found that Ypsilanti rated the lowest in the county for job access, economic well-being, and education. The white areas of Ann Arbor and its predominantly white suburb of Saline ranked the highest in these categories. 

These disparities have been exacerbated by policies that the City of Ann Arbor has put into place. Most apparent is the decision in 2014 to enact school of choice, which would allow students from outside of Ann Arbor attend wealthier Ann Arbor schools. The policy allowed the wealthier families of Ypsilanti to opt out of Ypsilanti public schools, instead attending schools with much more resources. The issue with the policy was that as students left Ypsilanti schools, so did state funding. In addition, many families could not afford to leave Ypsilanti to find other schools with better resources, forcing them to remain at underfunded institutions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this burden was felt disproportionately by the black community in Ypsilanti.

      This comes as a shock to many residents of Ann Arbor, which has the reputation as a progressive college town, but the history of the racial inequities of Ann Arbor go back much further. Many wealthy areas of Ann Arbor still have <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/news/ann-arbor/u-m-professors-reveal-racially-restrictive-covenants-ann-arbor-housing/">racially restrictive sections in their covenants<a>. These statements restrict people of color, especially Black Americans, from owning homes in certain parts of Ann Arbor. This was not traditional redlining, in the way we know took place in cities like Chicago and Detroit, rather it was a private agreement in the contract between buyer and seller. Nonetheless, until 1948, a white resident in many places of Ann Arbor could sue their neighbors if they sold their house to a black family. While a white family can no longer sue over this concern, the clause remains in many housing covenants to this day as a reminder that Ann Arbor might not be as progressive as it seems. 

In September of 2018, Washtenaw County formed a <a href="https://www.washtenaw.org/2658/Equity-in-Washtenaw">Racial Equity Office</a> that was tasked with, among other things, the purposeful redesignation of affordable housing. Affordable housing was yet another policy that had been used to keep people of color outside of the city borders. Most of the affordable housing that Washtenaw County built rests solely in the City of Ypsilanti. This concentrated the wealth of Ann Arbor securely within the city bounds and ensured that Ann Arbor remained unaffordable. It must also be noted that in the United States, almost a third of all residents who live in public housing are black and more than half are people of color– meaning that these policies segregated the two towns not only based upon wealth but subsequently based upon race as well. 

The history of the relationship between Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti is not a unique one within the context of the United States, and likely does not surprise the residents of Ypsilanti to learn about. However, the history that is often glossed over in school allows residents to believe that Ann Arbor is isolated from the racism that we read about in history books, when this is simply not the case.
